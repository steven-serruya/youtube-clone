    git clone https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_youtube_clone.git
    ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd project_youtube_clone
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:**
    ```plaintext
    REACT_APP_RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key_here
    ```

5. **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    ```

## Usage

- Enter a search term in the search bar to find videos.
- Click on any video to watch it.
- Browse related videos and channels in the sidebar.

## Technologies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework for building responsive and visually appealing designs.
- **React Router**: For navigation between different views.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the API.
- **RapidAPI**: For fetching video data from the YouTube API.

## API Integration

This project uses the YouTube Data API via RapidAPI to fetch video data, search results, and channel information.

## API Key

To use the YouTube Data API, you need to include your API key in the project. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory of the project if it doesn’t already exist.

2. **Add your API key** to the `.env` file with the following line:
    ```plaintext
    REACT_APP_RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key_here
    ```

   You can obtain the API key by signing up for a RapidAPI account and subscribing to the YouTube API plan. Make sure to replace `your_rapidapi_key_here` with the actual key you receive.

3. **Restart the development server** after adding the API key to ensure the application can access it.

This step is crucial for the application to fetch video data and function correctly.


### Endpoints Used

- **Search Videos**: To search for videos based on a query.
- **Get Video Details**: To fetch details about a specific video.
- **Get Related Videos**: To retrieve videos related to the one currently being viewed.
- **Get Channel Details**: To get information about a YouTube channel.
